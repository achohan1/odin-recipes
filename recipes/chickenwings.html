        wing recipe will quickly become a tried and true favorite. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 small chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 bottle Buffalo wing sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt</li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings
            into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15
            to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74
            degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
