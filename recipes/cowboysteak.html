    <h4>Cowboy Steak</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 beef cowboy steak (bone in ribeye)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>For compound butter, combine butter, parsley, mustard, rosemary, smoked paprika, garlic, and cayenne pepper
            in a small bowl. Spoon onto a sheet of waxed paper. Roll into a log. Wrap in the waxed paper. Chill in the
            refrigerator until firm, 30 minutes or up to 1 week.</li>
        <li>For steak, let steak stand at room temperature for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a wire rack in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high until it starts to smoke. Season steak generously
            with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Sear steak in the skillet until well-browned, 5 minutes per side, then 2 minutes on the fat cap side. Place
            steak on the rack in the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F (57
            degrees C) for medium rare, or 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium.</li>
        <li>Place steak on a cutting board. Tent loosely with foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Temperature will continue to
            rise as steak rests.</li>
        <li>Slice between meat and bone to separate. Thinly slice steak across the grain. Top sliced steak with Cowboy
            Compound Butter.</li>
